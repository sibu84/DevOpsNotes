Multiple playbooks can be calle dform one single playbook using "include"
This helps us in creating playbooks which are more modular

UseCase
Create an ansible play for installing maven.Call this play from another playbook

vim playbook15.yml
---
- name: Installing maven
  apt:
   name: maven
   state: present
...

vim playbook16.yml
---
- name: Calling other playbooks
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - include:
      playbooks15.yml


Create 4 plays 
1 for isntalling apache using apt
2 editing the content of index.html using copy
3 restaring apache2 using service
4 checking url is rechable using uri module

vim apache2_installation
---
- name: Installing apache2
  apt:
   name: apache2
   state: present
   update_cache: yes
...

vim edit_index.html
---
- name: editing index.html file
  copy:
   content: "Welcome to apache2 home page"
   dest: /var/www/html/index.html
...

vim apache2_restart
---
- name: Restarting apache2
  service:
   name: apache2
   state: restarted
...

vim apache2_url_response
---
- name: Checking apache2 url response
  uri:
   url: "http://192.168.60.22"
   status: 200
...

vim apache2_config
---
- name: Configuring apache2
  hosts: 192.168.60.22
  tasks:
   - include: "{{item}}"
     with_items:
      - apache_installation
      - edit_index.html
      - apache2_restart
      - apache2_url_response
...

To execute
ansible-playbook apache2_config -b


When conditions
-----------------
If we want ot execute a specific task only when
a particular condition is true then we can use
"when" conditions

UseCase
Install tree when a=10
vim playbook17.yml
---
- name: Implementing when
  hosts: all
  vars:
   a: 10
  tasks:
   - apt:
      name: tree
      state: present
     when: a==10
...


Debug Module
--------------
This module is used displaying the output of any executed module.The results can be captured in a register variable and using debug module display on the screen



Create an ansible playbook for installing apache2 and capture the results using register
and display them on the screen using debug module

---
- name: Using debug and register
  hosts: 192.168.60.22
  tasks:
   - name: Installing apache2
     apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
     register: results
   - name: Displaying the output
     debug:
      var: results
