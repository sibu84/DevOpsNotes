StatsModule
--------------
This is used to find the statistics of a direcotry or file
We can use it to find if a file or dir is present on a manged host.Similary we can check its permissions,ownership etc

USeCase
Crea an ansible playbook to chekc if a directory is presnet on a managed host or not.If the directory is present create a file in it

vim palybook19.yml
---
- name: Using stats module
  hosts: 192.168.60.22
  tasks:
   - name: Checking if /home/vagrant is present
     stat:
      path: /home/vagrant1
     register: results
   - name : Displaying output of stat module
     debug:
      var: results
   - name: Creating file
     file:
      name: /home/vagrant/file575
      state: touch
     when:
      results.stat.isdir == true
...

Create a user Ravi on all the managed nodes and assign passwod,home dir etc.If the user is laready present on any managed node donot make any changes to that user account

---
- name: Use Creation
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: checking home dir of user /home/ravi
     stat:
      path: /home/ravi
     register: results
   - name: Display output of stat module
     debug:
      var: results
   - name: User Creation
     user:
      name: ravi
      password: abc
      home: /home/vagrant/ravi
      shell: /bin/bash
     when:
      results.stat.exists == false

Tagging Modules
-----------------
The modules in a playbook can be given specific tags(names)
Using these tags it becomes possible to execute only that particular module rather than executing the entire playbook

UseCase
Install tree apahce2 and git.tag tree and paach2 but donot tag git installation
vim playbook21.yml
---
- name: Tagging modules
  hosts: 192.168.60.22
  tasks:
   - name: installing tree
     apt:
      name: tree
      state: present
     tags:
      tree_installation
   - name: installing apache
     apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
     tags:
      apache2_installation
   - name: installing git
      apt:
      name: git
      state: present
...

To execute all the tagged modules
ansible-playbook playbokk21.yml --tags=tagged -b

To execute all the untagged modules
ansible-playbook playbokk21.yml --tags=untagged -b

To execute modules with a specific tag name
ansible-playbook playbook21.yml --tags=apache2_installation                                                        -b



Handlers
------------
If we want to execute any module only if a previous modules is executed successfully and also it has done some changes we can use handlers

Handlers are used in combination with "notify" keyword
A successfull module sends its result to notify and based on that the handler gets execute

Handlers are given in allignment with the tasks

Handlers are executed only after all the tasks are execute

If multiple modules call the same handlers multiple time
the handler will be executed only once

The handlers are executed only in the order that they are given in the handlers section and not in the order that they are called in the tasks section

UseCase
Install apache2
Edit index.html file
If edit is successfull ie (done some changes) restart apache2

vim playbook23.yml

---
- name: Using handlers
  hosts: 192.168.60.23
  tasks:
   - name: Installing apache2
     apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
   - name: Edit index.html
     copy:
      content: "Welcome to intelliq"
      dest: /var/www/html/index.html
     notify: restart_apache2
  handlers:
   - name: restart_apache2
     service:
      name: apache2
      state: restarted
