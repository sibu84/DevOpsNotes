Variables in Ansible
======================
These are classified into 3 types
1 Global Scope
2 Play Scope
3 HostScope

Global Scope are declared at the command prompt and they 
can effect all the plays in the complete playbook

PlayScope variables are declared at the level of individual
plays and they will work on only a single play

Host Scope variables defined to work on a group of hosts
or on a single host as given in the inventory file

Global Scope variables
---------------------------
UseCase
Create a playbook which can be used for installing or
unistalling paakcges
vim playbooks6.yml
Go into insert mode by pressing 'i'

---
- name: Installing or uninstalling packages
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Installing/uninstalling
     apt:
      name: "{{a}}"
      state: "{{b}}"
      update_cache: "{{c}}"
...
Save and quit(Esc :wq)

To run the above playbook for installing tree
ansible-playbook playbook6.yml --extra-vars "a=tree b=present c=no" -b

We can also use it for uninstalling git
ansible-playbook playbook6.yml --extra-vars "a=git b=absent c=yes" -b
UseCase
Create a playbook for creating directories or file and also controlling the ownership permissions etc

vim playbook7.yml
Go into insert mode by pressing  'i'
---
- name: Creating files/directories changing perm etc
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: create file/dir
     file:
      name: "{{a}}"
      state: "{{b}}"
      owner: "{{c}}"
      group: "{{d}}"
      mode: "{{e}}"
...
Save and quit (Esc :wq)
To create a directory with the above play book
ansible-playbook playbook7.yml --extra-vars "a=/home/vagrant/d1 b=directory c=intelliq d=root e=777"                                                         -b

to create a file using the same playbook
 ansible-playbook playbook7.yml --extra-vars "a=/home/vagrant/d1/file1 b=touch c=vagrant d=intelliq                                                  e=000" -b

Playscope variable
UseCase
Create a playbook for installing apache2 using playscope
varaible.The same playbook should be capable of working
on installation or uinstallation of other packages

vim playbokk8.yml
Go into insert mode by pressing 'i'
---
- name: Installing apahce2
  hosts: all
  vars:
   a: apache2
   b: present
   c: no
  tasks:
   - name: Apache installation
     apt:
      name: "{{a}}"
      state: "{{b}}"
      update_cache: "{{c}}"
...
Save and quit(Esc :wq)

To run tha above playbook
ansible-playbook playbook8.yml -b
It will install apache2

The above playbook works as a template whose default behaviour is installing apache but we can make the same playbook to install any oher package instead of apache2
by passing the values as global scope

ansible-playbook playbook8.yml --extra-vars "a=git b=absent c=no" -b

Order of presendence
----------------------
Global scope variables are given the higgest priority
Host Scope variables have next level of priority
Play scope variables are given the least priority
