Ansible doesnot require any agent software to be installed on our machine.
Instead it uses passwordless ssh.
Note:Ansible uses agentless policy

1 Generate ssh keys on the controller machine
  ssh -keygen

2 Copy the public key into the all the managed hosts
  ssh-copy-id username@ip-adress-of-managed-host

3 Repeat Step No 2 for all the managed hosts

Ansible performs remote configuration by reading information
from a file called inventory file.The default inventory file is
present in /etc/ansible/hosts.
In this file we should define the ip adress of all the managed hosts that we want ansible to control

sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts
Go into insert mode by pressing i
Enter the ip adresses of all the managed hosts
192.168.60.12
192.168.60.13
192.168.60.14
192.168.60.15
Save and quit(Esc :wq)

Ansible uses the following thre modes for remote configuration
1 Ansible adhoc commands
2 Ansible playbooks
3 Ansible roles

Impotant modules in ansible
1 command : This is used for executing basic linux commands on 	    the remote machines
2 shell: This is used for executing linux commands which involve
	 redirection and piping
3 ping: Used to check if a remote manged host is pingable or not
4 copy: Used to copy files from controller into managed hosts
5 fetch: Used to copy files from managed hosts into controller
6 user: Used for creating users on the managed hosts and for
        controlling their accounts
7 file: Used for creating files and directories on the managed
        hosts
8 git: Used to automate the checkin and checkout process in
       git version controlling
9 apt: Used for installing packages on the ubuntu based linux        machines
10 yum:Used for installing packages in rhel,oel,centos,fedora 
11 servcie: Used for starting or stopping services
12 uri : used to check if a remote url is reachable or not
13 debug :Used to capture the output of any specific ansible
 	  module and display it on the console
14 ec2: Used for configuring servers on the AWS cloud


Adhoc commands
===============
Syntax:
   ansible all/group/ipadress -m modulename -a 'arguments'

UseCase1
Execute ls -l command on all the manged hosts
ansible all -m command -a 'ls -l'

UseCase2
Excecute ls -l command on all the managed nodes and store the output in file1
ansible all -m shell -a 'ls -l > file1' -b

UseCase3
Go to all the manged hosts and capture info about all the users who are using /bin/bash from /etc/passwd file and store in file2
ansible all -m shell -a 'grep /bin/bash /etc/passwd > file2' -b


UseCase4
Copy a file present on the controller into all the managed hosts
ansible all  -m copy -a 'src=ansbilesample dest=/home/vagrant' 
We can also copy directories along with all its subdirectories
and files
 ansible all -m copy -a 'src=d1 dest=/home/vagrant' -b
