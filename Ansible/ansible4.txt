Configuring ansible on AWS
=============================
1 Create 2 or more aws instances(Ubuntu14)
2 Name the 1st instance as controller
  and other instances as server1,2,3,etc
3 Open the terminal of controller machine   through git
4 Install ansible
5 Create a user called ansible
  sudo useradd -m ansible
6 Assign password for that user
  sudo passwd ansible

7 Open another gitbash and go to server1
8 sudo vim  /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  Search for passwordauthentication and
  change it from no to yes
9 Restart ssh service
  sudo service ssh restart
10 Reset passwd for ubuntu user
   sudo passwd ubuntu

Repeat Step-7-10 on all the managed hosts

11 Go to controller machine
13 sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts
   Enter tie private ips of all the managed    hosts

14 sudo su - ansible
15 ssh-keygen
16 ssh-copy-id ubuntu@private-ip-of-mangedhost
Repeat step 16 for all manged host ip adresses

Playbooks
===========
The adhoc commands that we have used till now can work only on one module and one set of arguments.

To perform complex configuration management activites we can use ansible playbooks
Playbooks are created in yml syntax and they are useful for running multiple ansible modules
with different set of arguments

Using playbooks it is possible to convert complex CM tasks into easily repetable routines

Create an ansible playbook for crearing directory on all the manged hosts and copying a file into that directoy

vim playbook1.yml
Go into insert mode by pressing i

---
- name: Creating dirs and coping files
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: create directory
     file:
      name: /home/ubuntu/dir1
      state: directory
   - name: copy file
     copy:
      src: /home/ansible/file1
      dest: /home/ubuntu/dir1
...

Save and quit (Esc :wq)

To check the syntax of the above playbook
ansible-playbook playbook1.yml --syntax-check

To run the above playbook
ansible-playbook playbook1.yml

Create an ansible playbook for creating a user
called intelliq on all the manged hosts and capture the user info from /etc/passwd file

vim playbook2.yml
Go into insertmode by pressing 'i'

---
- name: Creating users and capturing their info
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: User Creation
     user:
      name: intelliq
      password: mypassword
      home: /home/ansible
      shell: /bin/bash
   - name: Capture intelliq info from /etc/passwd
     shell: grep intelliq /etc/passwd > file1
   - name: Fetching file1 into controller
     fetch:
      src: /home/ubuntu/file1
      dest: /home/ansible
